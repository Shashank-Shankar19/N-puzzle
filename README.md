# N-Puzzle
N-puzzle test

This is my course homework, from Artificial Intelligence.

>Generate a large number of 8-puzzle and 8-queens instances and solve them (where possible) by hill climbing (steepest-ascent and first-choice variants), hill climbing with random restart, and simulated annealing. Measure the search cost and percentage of solved problems and graph these against the optimal solution cost. Comment on your results.

So I write this code in JAVA, for a simple test for N puzzle pro.blem
